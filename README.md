in this simple DevOps Proect i will push my codes into this github repository and when theres a push or 
when a change is been made in the repository, jenkins will trigger a build which will generate a Var file.
 
NOW, that var file will then be deployed into the EC2 and in the EC2 where we have a docker file which has a 
script for the script contain which will download a tomcat image from the docker hub and then copy the var file 
into the tomcat default directory and expose the port 8080

in progress wish me luck

and happy learning with me.
