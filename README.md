in this simple DevOps Proect i pushed a simple Default template of a Dotnet Core Application into my github repository connecting it to jenkins which makes any change  
or push in the github repository trigger a build in jenkins which which then generates a Var file.
 
NOW, that var file will then be deployed into the EC2 and in the EC2 where we have a docker file which has a script for the script contain which will download a tomcat image from the docker hub and then copy the var file into the tomcat default directory and expose the port 8080
